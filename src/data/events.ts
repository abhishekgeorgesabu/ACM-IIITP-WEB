        description: `### 1. Executive Summary
The inaugural day of the "Hour of AI" week focused on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Service Design, and Social Responsibility. Hosted by the IIITP ACM SIGCHI chapter, the event bridged the gap between technical functionality and holistic user experience. The session featured a keynote by Prof. Lara Piccolo, who argued that technology cannot be neutral and must be designed with a socio-technical perspective.

### 2. Session Agenda & Proceedings

#### I. Opening Ceremony
Welcome Address: Roshni Sahoo (Vice-Chair) initiated the event, introducing the chapter’s focus on combining technology with design methodologies.
Context Setting: The "Hour of AI" was framed not just as a technical discussion, but as an exploration of how AI impacts daily life and social scenarios.
Speaker Introduction: Dr. Shrikant Salve (Faculty Advisor) introduced Prof. Lara Piccolo, highlighting her background in Computer Science and HCI.

#### II. Keynote Address: "Service Design & Social Impact"
Speaker: Prof. Lara Schibelsky Godoy Piccolo
• From Products to Services: Prof. Piccolo distinguished between "products" and "services", defining a service as "something that helps people do something".
• The Ecosystem of Design: Introduced the "onion model" of contextual design to illustrate the complexity of services.
• Why Services Fail: Common failure points identified included cultural inappropriateness and poor training.
• Evaluation & Metrics: Discussed the necessity of maintenance and continuous measurement (KPIs) after a service is launched.

#### III. Interactive Q&A
• AI & Sustainability: Prof. Piccolo advised starting with the problem rather than the technology, using UN SDGs as a framework.
• Critical Usage: Urged students to view AI as a critical tool rather than a replacement.

#### IV. Conclusion
Vote of Thanks: Roshni Sahoo (Vice-Chair) delivered the closing remarks.
Call to Action: The session closed with a reminder that "there is no neutrality in technology."

### 3. Key Takeaways for Attendees
• Problem First, AI Second: Identify a human or social need first.
• Holistic View: Service design is about "designing social scenarios."
• Metrics Matter: A service's success must be quantifiable.
• Global Context: Modern design must be inclusive and socially responsible.`,

        description: `### 1. Event Overview
An interactive online session involving students from 9th grade to 12th grade was conducted on Artificial Intelligence, moving beyond theory into practical application. The session focused on how AI differs from traditional programming, how to use AI for academic study, and how to utilize "Vibe Coding" (Natural Language Programming) to build functional applications without extensive coding knowledge.

### 2. Session Breakdown

#### I. Introduction & Basics of Generative AI
Speaker: Piyush Kulkarni (Founder, Carter AI)
• AI vs. Traditional Programming: Explained that traditional programming relies on fixed logic, whereas AI systems learn from scenarios.
• Real-world Applications: Discussed the Instagram recommendation algorithm.
• Study Tools (NotebookLM): Demonstrated Google's NotebookLM as a study aid for generating summaries and podcasts.

#### II. Introduction to Rapid Prototyping & Vibe Coding
Speaker: Roshni Sahoo (Vice Chair)
• Vibe Coding Definition: Using natural language to generate programs.
• The Role of Humans: Emphasized that AI does not replace engineers; human oversight is required.
• Prompt Engineering: Taught that the quality of output depends on the quality of the prompt.

#### III. Hands-On Workshop: Building with Lovable.ai
The core practical segment involved students building a web game using the Lovable.ai platform.
• Project Goal: Create a game of your choice.
• Development Steps: Used temporary credentials, entered nature language prompts (e.g., "Make a catching game"), refined logic, and discussed UX & accessibility.
• Publishing: Demonstrated how to publish the game to a live URL.

### 3. Outcomes & Conclusion
